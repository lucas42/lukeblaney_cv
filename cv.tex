\section*{Employment}


\begin{itemize}

\item Financial Times: October 2016 - Present
\begin{itemize}\item
 {\bf Lead Architect - Content}\\
Working on our Universal Publishing Platform, delivering Content \& Metadata to our products, apps and third-parties.
\end{itemize}

\item Financial Times: December 2015 - October 2016
\begin{itemize}\item
 {\bf Platform Architect - Operational Intelligence}\\
 Working on monitoring, metrics \& log aggregation tools. Also started a new API-driven system for keeping track of our systems with automated runbook creation and monitoring management.
\end{itemize}

\item Financial Times: January 2015 - November 2015
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Integration Engineer - Strategic Products} \\
Working on migrating various systems to cloud-based infrastructure (mainly AWS), including sites like the FT's mobile web app.

(Note: officially, my job title did not change for this period. Included separately for clarity.)
\end{itemize}

\item Financial Times: December 2011 - December 2014
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Labs Developer - FT Labs}\\
I began this role focused on web development on a number of projects, such as the FT's HTML5 Web App and FastFT (a realtime news CMS \& front end). I frequently debugged a variety of live issues, from small intermittent bugs which can't be reproduced elsewhere to large show-stopping errors which light up monitoring displays like christmas trees.\par

However, during the role I became more involved with our integration with backend systems. I wrote a collection of libraries for developers to interact with various pieces of infrastructure (eg Databases, Varnish, Xapian search). I also rearchitectued our Varnish configuration and gave a talk about it at the ``VUG 8" conference in Berlin.\par

The departure of all our team's sysadmins within a short period of time pushed me to become focused managing the infrastructure itself.  I wrote a considerable amount of puppet configuration and  templates for configuration of other systems (Apache, Varnish etc) I also contributed to all major decisions regarding infrastructure within them team: combining operational requirements, architectural concerns, and the needs of developers interacting with the infrastructure.\par

Towards the end of my time with FT Labs, I took the lead in developing the team's internal tooling.  This involved a combination of hands-on coding with the co-ordination of others working on these tools.  The tools were eclectic in nature including those which dealt with deployments, live error collection and monitoring aggregation.
\end{itemize}

\item Assanka: November 2010 - December 2011
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Web Developer}\\
Worked on various web projects for a range of clients, doing both backend and frontend work. Backends included Wordpress, an in-house framework and vanilla PHP. Frontend javascript varied from simple jQuery-based interfaces, to large object-orientated systems which utilised many HTML5 features.
Assanka was acquired by the Financial Times at the end of 2011 and was later rebranded ``FT Labs".

\section*{Education}
\begin{itemize}

\item Edinburgh University: 2006 - 2010 \begin{itemize}\item {\bf BSc (Hons) Computer Science and Physics}\\
My joint degree, with an emphasis on Computer Science, covered specialist areas such as Distributed Systems, Multi-Agent Semantic Web Systems, Computer Security and Communication \& Networking.

One of the aspects of my degree which I particularly enjoyed was the opportunity to work with others to solve problems and challenges, for example, pair programming or as part of a larger group.  One group project involved developing a football-playing LEGO\textregistered robot which competed in a tournament against other robots.  The project required teamwork, communication and time management.  

As part of my honours project I created a web interface for a Semi-Automatic Guesstimation system which provided answers to questions asked by the user.   I also enabled the system to get information live from the Semantic Web using SPARQL, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) query language.
