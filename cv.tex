\section*{Employment}


\begin{itemize}

\item Financial Times: December 2011 - December 2014
\begin{itemize}\item
 {\bf FT Labs - Developer}\\
Following the FT's acquisition of Assanka, it was relaunched as FT Labs.  Whilst my official title is ``Labs developer", I've taken up various roles within the team:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\bf Web developer} - I continued working as a web developer on high profile projects such as the FT Web APP and Fast FT (A realtime streaming news platform).  I've also worked on several internal projects too, from simple bash scripts to monitoring systems aimed at aggregating status information from a variety of sources.
		\item {\bf Workstream Lead} - I lead a team of 3 people in change of infrasture and internal tooling for FT Labs.  This involves balancing various demands: support of current infrastructure, creation of infrastructure for new projects as well as the migration to use centrally managed infrastrucure.
		\item {\bf Technical Architect} - I'm frequently involved in planning the technical architecture for projects, both within FT Labs and for the FT as a whole.
		\item {\bf Integration Engineer} - I'm responsible for getting projects up and running in production and also live debugging when things go wrong.
	\end{itemize}
Normally these 4 roles would be done by different people, but as we have quite a small team, I've ended up doing them all concurrently.
\end{itemize}

\item Assanka: November 2010 - December 2011
\begin{itemize}\item

\section*{Education}
\begin{itemize}

\item Edinburgh University: 2006 - 2010 \begin{itemize}\item {\bf BSc (Hons) Computer Science and Physics}\\
My joint degree, with an emphasis on Computer Science, covered specialist areas such as Distributed Systems, Multi-Agent Semantic Web Systems, Computer Security and Communication \& Networking.

One of the aspects of my degree which I particularly enjoyed was the opportunity to work with others to solve problems and challenges, for example, pair programming or as part of a larger group.  One group project involved developing a football-playing LEGO\textregistered robot which competed in a tournament against other robots.  The project required teamwork, communication and time management.  

As part of my honours project I created a web interface for a Semi-Automatic Guesstimation system which provided answers to questions asked by the user.   I also enabled the system to get information live from the Semantic Web using SPARQL, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) query language.
